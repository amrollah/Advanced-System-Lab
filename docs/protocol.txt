This document specifies the layout of the strings the server accepts.
>>> denotes the content the client sends.
<<< denotes the answer one would expect on success from server.

[User creation]
To create a user send the following string to the server. It will return
the id of the new user as a string.
>>> "register\n"
<<< "OK\nid:{id|int}"

[Queue manipulation]
This string creates a queue named {name} and will return the id which represents
this queue.
>>>"create queue"
<<<"OK\nid:{id|int}

To delete a queue:
>>>"delete queue\nid:{id|int}"
<<<"OK\n"

[Messages]
To send a content use the following string, receiver is optional

>>>"send\nsender:{sender|int};queue:{queue|int};receiver:{receiver|int};content:{content|string}"

The following string lets you peek at a content, again the last three arguments are optional and will only be in the answer
if they are set.

>>>"get msg\nqueue:{queue|int};receiver:{receiver|int}"
<<<"OK\nsender:{sender|int};queue:{queue|int};content:{content|string};receiver:{receiver|int}"

The following string consumes a string, again same arguments as before

>>>"read msg\nqueue:{queue|int};receiver:{receiver|int}"
<<<"OK\nsender:{sender|int};queue:{queue|int};content:{content|string};receiver:{receiver|int}"
